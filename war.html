            <label class="butterdog"> Eris took her Apple of Discord and said it was for the
            most beautiful. Eris always tries to make people feel anger. She is the daughter
            of Nyx. Three goddesses claimed the apple. Aphrodite, Athena, and Hera claimed
            the apple. Zeus made Paris of Troy decide. The goddesses tried to bribe Paris
            into picking them. Aphrodite offered the most beautiful women, Athena offered
            military strength, and Hera offered royalty. Paris picked Aphrodite becuase
            of her offer. Hera and Athena have been enemies of Troy since. As promised,
            Aphrodite brought Paris Helen of Sparta because she was known as the most
            beautiful women. Paris took Helen to Troy without telling the people Sparta.
            Helen's father made a greek expedition to find Helen since Helen's father was
            the king. Helen's brother Agamemnon found out Helen was at Troy and he demanded
            they give her back. Paris did not return Helen though. This caused the Trojan
            War. A war between Greece and Troy. Helen loved Paris but beleived he was weak,
            and regretted starting the war. Greece tried to break into Troy but it was clear
            they weren't welcome. Odysseus had a plan though. A long time later, Odysseus
            gave Troy a wooden horse and said it was a peace offering. Troy took the horse,
            but little did they know their were greek warriors inside! They warriors came
            out of the horse, took Helen, and raided Troy. </label>
