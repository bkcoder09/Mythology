            <label class="butterdog"> Hades had fallen in love with Persephone so he decided
            to kidnap her. He found a beautiful flower called Narcissus and placed to
            distract her. While Persephone was busy looking at Narcissus Hades grabbed her
            and dragged her to his home. The Underworld. If you eat food from the Underworld
            you will be trapped there forever but Persehpone did not know this so she ate
            some pomegranate seeds. Persephone's mother, Demeter was the goddess of
            fertility and agriculture but become unconcerned for the harvest since her
            daughter was missing. Zeus demanded Hades return Persephone to her mother and
            Hades did but Persephone had eatan six out of the twelve pomegrante seeds so
            she had to stay in the Underowlrd for six months each year. Persephone is the
            goddess of the seasons so when she was out of the Underworld it's spring. When
            it was almsot time to go to the Underworld it's fall. When she was in the
            Underworld it's winter. When it's almost time for Persephone to leave the
            Underworld and see her mother it's summer. </label>
