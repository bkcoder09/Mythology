            <br>
            <label class="butterdog"> The Argonauts were a group of 50 people trying to
            steal the Golden Fleece which can heal anything. The Golden Fleece was in
            Colchis. Inside the palace which was home to King Atees. Medea is the King's
            daughter. By mistake, she got into the Argonauts boat nistead of her's. Medea
            fell in love with the captain of the Argonauts, Jason. Because Medea loved
            Jason, she would help them steal the Golden Fleece if Jason married her.
            Jason agreed to these terms. The fleece was in a garden protected by fiery
            bulls. Medea gave Jason a lotion that would protect him from the bulls.
            Jason put on the lotion, got past the bulls, stole the fleece, and got out of
            there. Medea's brother, Absyrtus came after them but Jason cut him into pieces.
            Jason married Medea since she helped him but Jason never actually loved Medea
            so he left her and ran off with Glauce. Glauce was the daughter of King Creon
            of Corinth. Driven by rage and jealousy, she killed Glauce and her sons. Medea
            married another man named Aegeus but then tried to poison his son, Theseus.
